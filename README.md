# Bash-begin

This is automatization of random generation, written by me for the test quest in the form of a library for future upgrade and usage.
This library includes codes for:
+ Number random generation;
+ Extracting a random string for a given file;
+ Random sequence's generation of kyrillic alphabet letters;
+ Random sequence's generation of latin alphabet letters and numbers;
+ A trial of generation datetime format for xml-type.

Here is my first week's experience with bash-scripts.
