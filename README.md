# Bash-begin

This is automatization of random generation, written by me for the test quest in the form of a library for future upgrade and usage.
This library includes `functions` for:
+ Number random generation;
+ Extracting a random string for a given file;
+ Random sequence's generation of kyrillic alphabet letters;
+ Random sequence's generation of latin alphabet letters and numbers;
+ A trial of generation datetime format for xml-type.

You can run this project locally just do:
+ Clone branch `git clone https://github.com/silver-mars/Bash-begin.git`
+ `cd Bash-begin`
+ create your own .sh-file and populate your code:</br>
`#!/bin/bash`</br>
`source ./random_library.sh`
+ Done. We have just used a library function inside a script.
Let's call the selected function and use it.

Here is my first week's experience with bash-scripts.
